This demonstrates PACCAR's active involvement in climate change mitigation initiatives.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR11\n","Response: Yes, PACCAR has a process to manage climate-related risks. The PACCAR SASB-ESG Report states that climate-related risks are called out in their Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. Through the ERM process, executive leaders are responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and managing risks, including climate-related risks. The risks are tracked, potential impacts are analyzed, mitigation strategies are evaluated, and metrics and KPIs are monitored. This demonstrates that PACCAR has integrated climate change into their multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR12\n","Response: Yes PACCAR discloses materially important Scope 3 emissions. According to the PACCAR SASB-ESG Report 2023, PACCAR's CDP report includes the disclosure of GHG Protocol annual Scope 3 GHG inventory, which is third-party verified. The report states that PACCAR monitors both absolute greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse gas emissions inventory per unit of revenue, including Scope 3 emissions. The report provides specific data on PACCAR's Scope 3 emissions for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR13\n","Response: No.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR14\n","Response: Yes, PACCAR has set long-term quantitative targets for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. According to the PACCAR SASB-ESG Report 2023, PACCAR has established greenhouse emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The targets include a 35% absolute reduction of CO2 emissions from PACCAR's global facilities between a baseline year of 2018 and a target year of 2030 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Additionally, PACCAR has a 25% reduction target for product use greenhouse gas emissions in grams of CO2 emissions per vehicle kilometer for Scope 3 emissions. These targets are publicly disclosed and can be found on the SBTi website.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR15\n","Response: Yes, climate change performance is a metric in the remuneration policy for senior executives at organization PACCAR. According to the PACCAR SASB-ESG Report 2023, the company's executive remuneration is linked to climate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as part of their climate transition plan. This is stated under the \"Governance\" section of the report, which outlines the details of PACCAR's TCFD-CDP Climate Transition Plan, including the link between executive remuneration and climate KPIs.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR16\n","Response: Yes, the strategy of PACCAR explicitly includes plans for addressing both the risks and opportunities related to climate change. According to the PACCAR SASB-ESG Report 2023, PACCAR has a Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) aligned climate transition plan, which includes governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics & targets consistent with the TCFD framework. This plan demonstrates a robust approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in their vehicles and facilities. PACCAR has also established greenhouse emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and has a net-zero target in line with the latest climate science.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR17\n","Response: Yes, organization PACCAR has publicly committed to climate scenario planning, specifically considering a 2 degrees Celsius scenario. In their SASB-ESG Report 2023, PACCAR states that they have established greenhouse emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) with the goal to help limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. The report also mentions that PACCAR has a well-below 2°C trajectory approved science-based target and is granted extensions until an SDA for transport is developed and approved.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR18\n","Response: No.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","Key: PACCAR19\n","Response: Yes, PACCAR ensures consistency between its climate change policy and the positions taken by trade associations of which it is a member. According to the PACCAR SASB-ESG Report 2023, PACCAR is a member of trade associations including the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association, National Association of Manufacturers, American Trucking Associations, and others. These trade associations provide a collective industry perspective and bring additional expertise to help inform public policy debates and rulemaking activities in areas such as vehicle safety, electrification, emissions reduction, alternative fuels, tax and trade policies, automation, and driver assistance technologies. This demonstrates PACCAR's commitment to aligning its climate change policy with the positions taken by these trade associations.\n","--------------------------------------------------\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Add 'pred_label' key to each entry in master_dict1 based on the response\n","for key, value in master_dict1.items():\n","    if value['response'] and value['response'].strip().lower().startswith(\"yes\"):\n","        value['pred_label'] = 1\n","    else:\n","        value['pred_label'] = 0"],"metadata":{"id":"KJfF0SIFZX3-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1693224974991,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Emanuel L","userId":"06932353726127540127"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#From text to json"],"metadata":{"id":"JrGxGgl-Xzk_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# import ast\n","# import json\n","\n","# # Convert text content to dictionary\n","# def content_to_dict_updated(content):\n","#     \"\"\"Converts the string content to a dictionary, handling lines without colons.\"\"\"\n","#     lines = content.strip().split(\"\\n\")\n","#     result_dict = {}\n","#     for line in lines:\n","#         if \":\" not in line:\n","#             continue\n","#         key, value_str = line.split(\":\", 1)\n","#         key = key.strip()\n","#         value_dict = ast.literal_eval(value_str.strip())\n","#         result_dict[key] = value_dict\n","#     return result_dict\n","\n","# # Read the content of the text files\n","# with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/ChatGPT -
